## Package 2 (gradient descent methods) examples

* Requires gradient to be present and computable

Minimization of a 2-argument function from a given initial point. Rosenbrock function is used for testing, minization process can be dynamically tracked. All consequent plots support dynamics. Following example showcases steepest descent method.

## Package 3 (nonlinear conjugate gradient methods) examples

* Requires gradient to be present and computable
* Conjugate gradient methods can follow narrow (ill-conditioned) valleys, where the steepest descent method slows down and follows a criss-cross pattern

Minimization of a 2-argument function from a given initial point. Rosenbrock function is used for testing, minization process can be dynamically tracked. Following example showcases nonlinear conjugate gradient method with Hessian matrix.

## Package 4 (Newton's methods) examples

* Requires Hessian to be present and computable
* Newton's method can minimize any polynomial of Nth order in N-1 steps

Minimization of a 2-argument function from a given initial point. Rosenbrock function is used for testing, minization process can be dynamically tracked. Following example showcases modified Newton's method with step reduction.

## Package 6 (direct search methods) examples

* Direct search methods do not require a gradient, thus can be used with non-continuous and non-differentiable functions

Minimization of a 2-argument function from a given initial point. Rosenbrock function is used for testing, minization process can be dynamically tracked. Following example showcases cyclic coordinate descent.

## Package 7 (simplex methods) examples

* Simplex methods do not require a gradient, thus can be used with non-continuous and non-differentiable functions

Minimization of a 2-argument function from a given initial point. Rosenbrock function is used for testing, minization process can be dynamically tracked. Following example showcases Nelder-Mead method.

## Package 8 (barrier methods) examples

* Barrier methods use penalty functions to restrict minimization to a given region g(x, y) < 0
* Through generally reliable, a large step enough can overshoot the barrier, which leads to a longer convergence

Minimization of a 2-argument function from a given initial point restricted to a region. Rosenbrock function is used for testing. Following example showcases exterior barrier method.

## Usage

Config parameters at the top of each package to select function, method, precision, starting point, boundarier and etc. Minimization can be tracked real-time and most consequent plots support dynamics.

## Requirements

To launch Mathematica packages one may need a valid Wolfram Mathematica license. As an alternative packages can be converted to Jypiter notebooks and executed with Wolfram Lang.
